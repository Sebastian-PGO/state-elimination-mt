# State Elimination as Model Transformation Problem
created for TCC 2017

Implementation for the state elimination algorithm descriped in the paper can be downloaded from JFLAP website:
http://www.jflap.org/

the compact and simplified implementation can be found here:
https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/sinem-getir/tcc2017/view/SimplifiedJFLAP.zip

We extended the implementation for probabilistic version of state elimination in the folder 3) ProbJFLAP/

Required resources are included in other two projects:

1)ExperimentalData is an EMF project and includes
- metamodel of Transition graphs
- EMF instance models under ..testdata/emf for each specific tasks

2)EvaluationFramework is a Java project and includes

- Evaluation framework for the possible solutions
- Tests for the Regex correctness with positive and negative data under ../testdata
